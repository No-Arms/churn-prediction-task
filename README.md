# Customer Churn Prediciton

During the interview process for a Junior Data Scientist role, I was assigned a task build a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer churn based on the provided fabricated customer dataset.

After the data preparation and model selection steps, I submited a 3-page report and presented my findings.

Though there are many other possible steps I could have used here, this process was to be done over a week which did limit the time I had available to investigate their proper implementation.
